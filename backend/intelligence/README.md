# Business Intelligence Engine

## Overview

The Business Intelligence Engine is a comprehensive suite of AI-powered analytics modules that provide data-driven insights, revenue optimization, and predictive analytics for the AutoGuru Universal platform. This engine transforms raw usage and performance data into actionable business intelligence.

## Module Architecture

### 1. Usage Analytics Engine (`usage_analytics.py`)
Tracks and analyzes comprehensive usage patterns across all platforms and features.

**Key Features:**
- Platform usage tracking (posts, engagement, revenue by platform)
- Feature adoption analysis
- User behavior patterns
- Cross-platform correlation analysis
- Automation efficiency metrics

**Sample Insights:**
- "Instagram is your highest revenue-generating platform with $4,500 generated"
- "Viral optimization feature shows 85% correlation with revenue"
- "Automation saved 185.5 hours across all platforms"

### 2. Performance Monitoring System (`performance_monitor.py`)
Real-time performance monitoring with predictive alerts and anomaly detection.

**Key Features:**
- System performance metrics (API response times, uptime, resource usage)
- Content generation performance tracking
- Revenue performance monitoring
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Predictive capacity planning

**Capabilities:**
- Detects performance degradation before it impacts users
- Predicts system capacity issues 30-90 days in advance
- Sends real-time alerts for critical performance issues

### 3. Revenue Tracking Engine (`revenue_tracker.py`)
Comprehensive revenue tracking with multi-touch attribution modeling.

**Key Features:**
- Direct revenue tracking by source, campaign, and content type
- Multi-touch attribution models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based)
- Individual post revenue impact tracking
- Customer lifetime value analysis
- Conversion funnel optimization

**Attribution Models:**
- **First Touch**: Credits first interaction
- **Last Touch**: Credits final interaction before conversion
- **Linear**: Equal credit to all touchpoints
- **Time Decay**: More credit to recent interactions
- **Position Based**: 40% first, 40% last, 20% middle

### 4. AI Pricing Optimization (`ai_pricing.py`)
AI-driven pricing optimization with mandatory admin approval workflow.

**Key Features:**
- Price elasticity analysis by service tier
- Competitive pricing intelligence
- Demand prediction modeling
- Value-based pricing recommendations
- Risk assessment for pricing changes

**Admin Approval Workflow:**
1. AI generates pricing suggestion with confidence score
2. Prediction of revenue impact and customer churn risk
3. Admin reviews comprehensive analysis
4. Admin approves/rejects with notes
5. System implements approved changes with 30-day notice

## Key Classes and Interfaces

### Base Intelligence Engine
```python
class UniversalIntelligenceEngine(ABC):
    async def collect_data(timeframe: AnalyticsTimeframe) -> Dict
    async def analyze_data(data: Dict) -> List[IntelligenceInsight]
    async def generate_recommendations(insights: List) -> List[str]
    async def get_business_intelligence(timeframe: AnalyticsTimeframe) -> Dict
```

### Intelligence Insight Structure
```python
@dataclass
class IntelligenceInsight:
    metric_type: BusinessMetricType
    insight_text: str
    confidence_score: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    impact_level: str  # "high", "medium", "low"
    actionable_recommendations: List[str]
    supporting_data: Dict[str, Any]
```

### Business Metrics
```python
@dataclass
class BusinessMetrics:
    # Revenue metrics
    total_revenue: float
    revenue_growth_rate: float
    revenue_per_post: float
    
    # Engagement metrics
    engagement_rate: float
    viral_coefficient: float
    
    # Efficiency metrics
    roi_percentage: float
    automation_savings: float
    
    # Predictive metrics
    predicted_revenue_next_period: float
    churn_risk_score: float
    growth_potential_score: float
```

## Usage Examples

### Get Usage Analytics
```python
usage_engine = UsageAnalyticsEngine(client_id)
intelligence = await usage_engine.get_business_intelligence(
    timeframe=AnalyticsTimeframe.MONTH
)

# Access insights
for insight in intelligence['insights']:
    print(f"{insight.insight_text} (Confidence: {insight.confidence_score})")
    for recommendation in insight.actionable_recommendations:
        print(f"  - {recommendation}")
```

### Start Real-time Monitoring
```python
monitor = PerformanceMonitoringSystem(client_id)
await monitor.start_real_time_monitoring()

# Monitoring runs continuously, sending alerts for:
# - System health issues
# - Performance degradation
# - Revenue anomalies
```

### Track Post Revenue Impact
```python
revenue_tracker = RevenueTrackingEngine(client_id)
impact = await revenue_tracker.track_post_revenue_impact(
    post_id="post_123",
    platform="instagram",
    content={"type": "video", "hashtags": ["#business"]}
)

print(f"Revenue attributed: ${impact['revenue_attribution']['total_attributed_revenue']}")
```

### Generate Pricing Suggestions
```python
pricing_ai = AIPricingOptimization(client_id)
data = await pricing_ai.collect_data(AnalyticsTimeframe.QUARTER)
insights = await pricing_ai.analyze_data(data)
suggestions = await pricing_ai.generate_pricing_suggestions(data, insights)

# Submit for admin approval
for suggestion in suggestions:
    if suggestion['confidence_score'] > 0.8:
        approval_id = await pricing_ai.submit_pricing_suggestion_for_approval(suggestion)
```

## Analytics Timeframes

- `HOUR`: Last hour of data
- `DAY`: Last 24 hours
- `WEEK`: Last 7 days
- `MONTH`: Last 30 days
- `QUARTER`: Last 90 days
- `YEAR`: Last 365 days

## Business Metric Types

## Testing

Comprehensive integration tests are provided in `tests/integration/test_business_intelligence.py`:

```bash
# Run all BI tests
pytest tests/integration/test_business_intelligence.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/integration/test_business_intelligence.py::TestBusinessIntelligenceIntegration::test_complete_bi_workflow
```

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for full dependencies. Key requirements:
- pandas, numpy: Data analysis
- scikit-learn: Machine learning models
- sqlalchemy: Database operations
- redis: Caching and real-time data
- prometheus-client: Metrics collection

## Security Considerations

1. **Pricing Changes**: All pricing suggestions require explicit admin approval
2. **Data Access**: Client data is isolated by client_id
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse
4. **Audit Logging**: All significant actions are logged

## Performance Optimization

1. **Caching**: Frequently accessed metrics are cached in Redis
2. **Async Processing**: All operations are asynchronous
3. **Batch Processing**: Large datasets processed in batches
4. **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries with proper indexing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Models**: Deep learning for better predictions
2. **A/B Testing Framework**: Built-in experimentation platform
3. **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable BI dashboards
4. **Export Capabilities**: PDF/Excel report generation
5. **Webhook Integrations**: Real-time data push to external systems
