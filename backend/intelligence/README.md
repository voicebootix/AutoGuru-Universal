# Business Intelligence Engine

## Overview

The Business Intelligence Engine is a comprehensive suite of AI-powered analytics modules that provide data-driven insights, revenue optimization, and predictive analytics for the AutoGuru Universal platform. This engine transforms raw usage and performance data into actionable business intelligence.

## Module Architecture

### Core Modules

#### 1. Usage Analytics Engine (`usage_analytics.py`)
Tracks and analyzes comprehensive usage patterns across all platforms and features.

**Key Features:**
- Platform usage tracking (posts, engagement, revenue by platform)
- Feature adoption analysis
- User behavior patterns
- Cross-platform correlation analysis
- Automation efficiency metrics

**Sample Insights:**
- "Instagram is your highest revenue-generating platform with $4,500 generated"
- "Viral optimization feature shows 85% correlation with revenue"
- "Automation saved 185.5 hours across all platforms"

#### 2. Performance Monitoring System (`performance_monitor.py`)
Real-time performance monitoring with predictive alerts and anomaly detection.

**Key Features:**
- System performance metrics (API response times, uptime, resource usage)
- Content generation performance tracking
- Revenue performance monitoring
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Predictive capacity planning

**Capabilities:**
- Detects performance degradation before it impacts users
- Predicts system capacity issues 30-90 days in advance
- Sends real-time alerts for critical performance issues

#### 3. Revenue Tracking Engine (`revenue_tracker.py`)
Comprehensive revenue tracking with multi-touch attribution modeling.

**Key Features:**
- Direct revenue tracking by source, campaign, and content type
- Multi-touch attribution models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based)
- Individual post revenue impact tracking
- Customer lifetime value analysis
- Conversion funnel optimization

**Attribution Models:**
- **First Touch**: Credits first interaction
- **Last Touch**: Credits final interaction before conversion
- **Linear**: Equal credit to all touchpoints
- **Time Decay**: More credit to recent interactions
- **Position Based**: 40% first, 40% last, 20% middle

#### 4. AI Pricing Optimization (`ai_pricing.py`)
AI-driven pricing optimization with mandatory admin approval workflow.

**Key Features:**
- Price elasticity analysis by service tier
- Competitive pricing intelligence
- Demand prediction modeling
- Value-based pricing recommendations
- Risk assessment for pricing changes

**Admin Approval Workflow:**
1. AI generates pricing suggestion with confidence score
2. Prediction of revenue impact and customer churn risk
3. Admin reviews comprehensive analysis
4. Admin approves/rejects with notes
5. System implements approved changes with 30-day notice

### Strategic Enhancements

#### 1. Enhanced ML Models (`enhanced_ml_models.py`)
Advanced machine learning models for better predictions and insights.

**Features:**
- **EnhancedAnomalyDetector**: Uses Isolation Forest + Deep Learning for anomaly detection
- **PredictiveRevenueModel**: Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)
- **CustomerSegmentationEngine**: AI-powered customer clustering with RFM analysis

**Benefits:**
- More accurate anomaly detection with fewer false positives
- Revenue predictions with confidence intervals
- Automatic customer segmentation (champions, at-risk, growth potential)

#### 2. A/B Testing Framework (`ab_testing.py`)
Scientific approach to testing pricing and content changes.

**Features:**
- Pricing experiments with statistical significance
- Content variation testing
- Automatic sample size calculation
- Multi-variant testing support
- Real-time experiment monitoring

**Use Cases:**
- Test pricing changes on specific customer segments
- Compare content strategies across platforms
- Validate feature effectiveness before full rollout

#### 3. Real-Time Streaming (`realtime_streaming.py`)
WebSocket support for live dashboard updates.

**Features:**
- Real-time metric streaming
- Configurable update frequencies
- Multi-metric subscriptions
- Efficient data aggregation

**Implementation:**
```python
# WebSocket endpoint: /ws/bi-dashboard
# Subscribe to real-time updates
{
    "type": "subscribe",
    "client_id": "client_123",
    "metric_types": ["revenue", "engagement", "performance"],
    "update_frequency": 30
}
```

#### 4. Intelligent Caching (`caching_strategy.py`)
Smart caching strategy for optimal performance.

**Features:**
- Multi-level caching (Redis + in-memory)
- Automatic cache invalidation based on events
- Cache warming for frequently accessed data
- Compression for large datasets

**Usage:**
```python
@cache_intelligence_data(namespace="revenue", expire_minutes=30)
async def get_revenue_data(self, timeframe):
    # Method automatically cached
    pass
```

#### 5. Advanced Alerting (`advanced_alerting.py`)
Intelligent alert routing and escalation.

**Features:**
- Pattern-based alert detection (spike, drop, trend, recurring)
- Multi-channel delivery (email, webhook, Slack, SMS)
- Smart escalation for recurring issues
- Alert cooldown to prevent spam

**Alert Patterns:**
- **Spike/Drop**: Sudden changes in metrics
- **Trend**: Concerning directional changes
- **Recurring**: Regular pattern of issues
- **Anomaly**: Unusual behavior detected by ML

```bash
# Run all BI tests
pytest tests/integration/test_business_intelligence.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/integration/test_business_intelligence.py::TestBusinessIntelligenceIntegration::test_complete_bi_workflow
```

## Dependencies

3. **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse
4. **Audit Logging**: All significant actions are logged
5. **WebSocket Security**: Authentication required for real-time connections

## Future Roadmap

1. **Predictive Churn Models**: ML models to predict customer churn
2. **Natural Language Insights**: GPT-powered insight generation
